# Fork-Friendly PowerShell Testing Workflow - Task Tracker

## Project Overview
Create a comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow that enables forked repositories to run the complete psPAS PowerShell module test suite (1870+ tests) on Windows PowerShell 5.1, complementing the existing AppVeyor CI/CD pipeline.

**Goal**: Enable contributors to validate changes in forks without requiring access to AppVeyor  
**Strategy**: Use temporary local testing with act binary to develop workflow, then clean up for production  
**Local Testing**: Temporary setup - will be removed once workflow works on GitHub  
**Documentation Approach**: Continuous documentation throughout all tasks - no waiting until the end  
**Estimated Total Time**: 4-6 hours with parallel execution  
**Target Commits**: 5 strategic commits for validation and deployment

## Project Context

### psPAS Module Structure
- **Module Manifest**: `psPAS/psPAS.psd1` (version 6.4.85)
- **Root Module**: `psPAS/psPAS.psm1` (dynamic function loading)
- **Public Functions**: `psPAS/Functions/` (organized by domain: Authentication, Accounts, Safes, etc.)
- **Private Functions**: `psPAS/Private/` (core utilities like `Invoke-PASRestMethod.ps1`)
- **Tests**: `Tests/` directory with 1870+ Pester tests across 205+ files
- **Build Scripts**: `build/` directory (build.ps1, test.ps1, deploy scripts)

### Current CI/CD (AppVeyor)
- **Primary CI**: AppVeyor handles build, test, package, sign, and deploy to PowerShell Gallery
- **Test Command**: `pwsh.exe -File .\build\test.ps1` (runs all Pester tests)
- **Dependencies**: Pester, PSScriptAnalyzer required
- **Project Focus**: For this implementation, we prioritize workflow execution over test pass rates

### Target Environment
- **Runner**: `windows-2022` (includes PowerShell 5.1)
- **Shell**: `powershell` (not `pwsh` - must use Windows PowerShell)
- **Test Scope**: All 1870+ tests for comprehensive coverage
- **Execution Time**: Target <20 minutes for complete test suite

## Technical Reference

### Act Binary Commands
```bash
# Basic act binary usage (pre-installed at ./bin/act)
./bin/act --version                    # Check version
./bin/act -l                          # List workflows  
./bin/act -n                         # Dry run
./bin/act push                       # Simulate push event
./bin/act pull_request               # Simulate PR event
./bin/act workflow_dispatch          # Manual trigger

# Using wrapper script
./test-workflow-local.sh --list       # List workflows
./test-workflow-local.sh --dry-run    # Dry run validation
./test-workflow-local.sh push         # Simulate push event
```

### PowerShell Module Installation (CI Environment)
```powershell
# Required modules with specific configurations
Install-Module -Name Pester -Force -Scope CurrentUser -SkipPublisherCheck
Install-Module -Name PSScriptAnalyzer -Force -Scope CurrentUser

# psPAS module import (fixes known CI issues)
Import-Module ./psPAS/psPAS.psd1 -Force -Global
```

### Known Issues and Solutions
1. **Module Loading Error**: "No modules named 'psPAS' are currently loaded"
   - **Solution**: Use `-Global` flag and verify import before test execution
2. **Pester Version Conflicts**: Different Pester versions have different APIs
   - **Solution**: Use `New-PesterConfiguration` for v5+ compatibility
3. **Test Execution**: Some tests may fail due to CI environment differences
   - **Approach**: Focus on workflow execution, not individual test results

### Workflow File Requirements
- **Location**: `.github/workflows/test-powershell.yml`
- **Name**: "PowerShell Tests (Fork-Friendly)"
- **Triggers**: `push: [main, master, develop]`, `pull_request: [main, master]`
- **Manual Trigger**: Include `workflow_dispatch` for manual testing
- **Artifacts**: Upload test results as `test-results-${{ github.run_id }}`

### Documentation Standards
- **Inline Comments**: Explain every non-obvious configuration choice
- **Step Names**: Use descriptive names that explain what each step does
- **Error Messages**: Include troubleshooting information in failure messages
- **LOCAL_TESTING.md Structure**:
  ```markdown
  # Local Testing Guide
  ## Prerequisites
  ## Binary Setup
  ## Script Usage
  ## Troubleshooting
  ## Known Limitations
  ```

## Commit Strategy

**Strategic Commits for GitHub Actions Validation:**

1. **Commit 1 (Task D2)**: Basic workflow structure validation
2. **Commit 2 (Task F2)**: Dependency management validation  
3. **Commit 3 (Task H2)**: Complete workflow with test execution
4. **Commit 4 (Task K3)**: Production deployment with optimizations
5. **Commit 5 (Task L3)**: Final cleanup removing local testing files

**Rationale**: Local `act` testing cannot fully replicate GitHub Actions environment, so strategic commits validate key milestones on actual GitHub Actions infrastructure.

## Phase 7: Cleanup Local Testing Infrastructure

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT: Protected Files During Cleanup**  
> During cleanup, the following files in `.github/` are **PROTECTED** and must **NEVER** be deleted:
> - All GitHub community files (FUNDING.yml, templates, etc.)
> - Only temporary testing files should be removed (act binary, test scripts, test workflows)
> - The goal is to remove testing infrastructure while preserving all existing GitHub functionality

### Task L1: Remove Act Binary Setup

  - [ ] Clean up any binary-related temporary files
  - [ ] **Documentation**: Update documentation to remove act binary references
  - [ ] **CRITICAL**: Preserve ALL GitHub community files (FUNDING.yml, ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md, PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md, feature_request.md, issue-report.md)
- **Deliverable**: Clean repository without act binary and testing infrastructure, with GitHub community files preserved
- **Acceptance**: Repository contains production GitHub Actions workflow and all original GitHub community files intact
- **Notes**: Only execute after confirming GitHub Actions workflow is working properly. NEVER delete GitHub community files.

### Task L2: Update Final Documentation
